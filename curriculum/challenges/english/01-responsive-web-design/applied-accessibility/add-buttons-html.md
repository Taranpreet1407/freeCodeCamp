# --description--
The <button> tag defines a clickable button.

Inside a <button> element you can put text (and tags like <i>, <b>, <strong>, <br>, <img>, etc.). That is not possible with a button created with the <input> element!

Always specify the type attribute for a <button> element, to tell browsers what type of button it is.
